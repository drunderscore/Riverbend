# Riverbend
A utility to aid the process of analyzing XNA file types like XNB.

This project comes in two parts:
- `LibXNA`: Abstract library to help parse XNA file formats (primarily XNB)
- `Riverbend`: Graphical interface to use LibXNA

## Build
Simply run `cmake`. I personally use Ninja, but you can use Visual Studio in just the same way.

## File type not supported?
You can make an issue about any file type that isn't supported (even if it is specific to a game or platform).
Another way to get your file type implemented is by doing it yourself!

## Documentation?
Take a look into the `resources` directory to see the information I referenced while creating Riverbend/LibXNA,
and test files I used.
